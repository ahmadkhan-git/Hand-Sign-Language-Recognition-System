## Project Overview

The **Hand Sign Language Recognition System** is a complete pipeline that allows users to **collect hand gesture images**, **train a machine learning model**, and **recognize gestures in real-time** through a webcam feed.  
It aims to bridge communication gaps by providing a simple and practical hand sign recognition system.

---

## Features

- Collect Aâ€“Z hand gesture images for both **right** and **left** hands.
- Landmark detection using **MediaPipe Hands**.
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict gestures.
- **Real-time** hand gesture recognition through webcam.
- User-friendly **Tkinter GUI**.
- **Text-to-Speech** functionality for recognized letters.
- Supports **individual hand training** for improved accuracy.

## Project Structure

| File Name            | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| `collect_imgs.py`     | Collect images for each hand gesture class (A-Z). |
| `create_dataset.py`   | Extract landmarks and generate dataset from collected images. |
| `train_classifier.py` | Train and save the machine learning model. |
| `menu.py`             | Launch the GUI for real-time gesture recognition. |
| `data/`               | Folder where collected images are saved. |
| `data.pickle`         | Dataset containing landmark features and labels. |
| `model.p`             | Saved trained Random Forest model. |
